rtl_tcp_andro 

Is an application that allows you to use I/Q packet source in your Android applications.

All you need is to launch an intent in the form "iqsrc://rtl_tcp_arguments" where you replace rtl_tcp_arguments with the arguments that you want your application to run rtl_tcp with and the magic will be done behind the scenes! More HOWTO coming soon!

Internals:

A modification of rtl_tcp and libusb-1.0 for running on Android (also works on other Linux based systems) 
 
It is compatible with the original rtl_tcp with the following exceptions: 
 
Added features: 
 - Opening devices using a file descriptor (very important for Android) 
 - An additional command for closing the app remotely and setting tuner gain in percentage 
 
Possible bugs: 
 - Once the client closes, rtl_tcp closes with it. This is a desired behavior on Android but probably undesired if used for a client. 
 
Note: 
The rtl-sdr folder is completely unmodified. Therefore if a new version of rtl-sdr is released, just replace this folder with the newer version and recompile - everything should work out of the box. 
 
Files modified in libusb-1.0 to create libusb-andro: 
 core.c, libusb.h and libusbi.h - to header for and implementation of the open2 function which takes an already open file descriptor 
 linux_usbfs.c - to create a libusb handle from the fd 
 
Compilation: 
To compile for Android, use the Android.mk file in the jni directory 
To compile for Linux invoke make. Binary will be created in the current directory 
 
The modifications are released under GNU. See COPYING for details.
